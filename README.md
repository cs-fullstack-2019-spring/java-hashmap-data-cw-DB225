### Exercise 1:
Modify IC work to handle when the file is not available using try/catch

- Start the program
- While running, delete the high scores file
- When you finish the game, handle the exception by displaying the message ```High scores file not found. Creating a new High Scores file...```. Create a new file, and log the high score.

### Exercise 2:
Create a prepopulated text file of at least 3 dictionary entries (word, definition).

Write a program that loads the entries into a Hash map, and prompts the user for a word to lookup.

If the word is found, display its definition.

### Extra:
Enhance program so that it will keep letting the User search for definitions until they type```quit```
